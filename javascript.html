  <h1>Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
  <p>JavaScript is a versatile programming language that is primarily used for creating interactive web pages. It was originally developed to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to static HTML pages. Since then, JavaScript has evolved into a powerful and widely used language for both front-end and back-end web development.</p>

  <h2>What Can You Do with JavaScript?</h2>
  <p>JavaScript can be used for a variety of purposes in web development:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Client-Side Scripting:</strong> JavaScript runs on the client-side (in the browser) and allows you to create dynamic web content, handle form validation, manipulate HTML elements, and respond to user interactions.</li>
    <li><strong>DOM Manipulation:</strong> JavaScript provides a powerful API called the Document Object Model (DOM) that allows you to interact with the structure and content of a web page. You can dynamically create, modify, and delete HTML elements, change styles, and handle events.</li>
    <li><strong>Ajax and Asynchronous Programming:</strong> JavaScript enables you to make asynchronous requests to a server using Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) and update parts of a web page without reloading the entire page.</li>
    <li><strong>Front-End Frameworks and Libraries:</strong> JavaScript has numerous frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which provide pre-built components and abstractions to simplify front-end development.</li>
    <li><strong>Server-Side Development:</strong> With the introduction of Node.js, JavaScript can now be used for server-side development. This allows you to build web servers, APIs, and perform other server-side tasks using JavaScript.</li>
  </ul>
